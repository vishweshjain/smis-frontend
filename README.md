# SmartStudent Management System - Frontend

Welcome to the **SmartStudent Management System**! This project is the frontend interface designed for managing student information, attendance, results, and more in an educational institution.

## Project Overview

The **SmartStudent Management System** is a web-based application that provides an interface for students to interact with their academic details, including:

- **Profile Management**: View and update personal details.
- **Attendance**: Check attendance records in a calendar format.
- **Results**: View exam results and grades.
- **Timetable**: Access daily class schedules.
- **Fees**: Review fee details and payment history.
- **Inbox/Chat**: Communicate with faculty or administration via a built-in messaging system.

This repository contains the **frontend** of the system, which is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with JSP integration for dynamic content rendering.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices of all screen sizes.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: An easy-to-use sidebar for quick access to different student sections.
- **Profile Photo**: Displays the student’s profile picture, or a default photo if none is uploaded.
- **Dynamic Content**: Uses JSP to dynamically load user-specific content like profile and attendance.
- **Smooth Animations**: Sidebar and elements have smooth transitions and animations for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout, including animations and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Sidebar toggle and dynamic content behavior.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: For rendering dynamic content like student profiles and attendance.
- **JSTL (Java Standard Tag Library)**: Used for conditional content rendering and data manipulation.

ges and icons used in the project └── scripts/ └── dashboard.js # JavaScript for sidebar toggle and other functions

2. **Set up a local server (optional):** Since JSP is involved, you will need a Java-based server such as Apache Tomcat to run the application.

- **Ensure that Tomcat is properly configured in your development environment.**
- **Place the project files in the appropriate webapp directory of your server.**

3. **Navigate to the project:** Open the project in your favorite IDE or text editor (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ).

4. **Run the application:** Start the server and open the application in your web browser:
